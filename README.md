# Reptile Search Algorithm (RSA): A nature-inspired optimizer python and matlab code
Reptile Search Algorithm (RSA) is a novel nature-inspired meta-heuristic optimizer, motivated by the hunting behaviour of Crocodiles. The performance of the proposed RSA is evaluated using twenty-three classical test functions, thirty CEC2017 test functions, ten CEC2019 test functions, and seven real-world engineering problems.
